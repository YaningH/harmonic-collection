    <h4>Going on a walk by yourself can be helpful when you're trying to get over someone. It gives you a chance to clear your mind, reflect on your emotions, and focus on yourself. Physical activity, even something as simple as walking, can boost your mood by releasing endorphins. Being outdoors, especially in nature, can also provide a sense of peace and help you gain perspective on the situation. It might not be a cure-all, but it's a healthy way to give yourself some space and mental clarity. Have you tried it before?</h4>
